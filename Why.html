<h3> The internet can be used to spread many ideas including good ideas and bad ideas. Bully trends that are exchanged on social media are bad because they teach people that making fun of people and saying messed up and evil things is okay. The internet today is used so much, and little kids are starting to use the platforms too, though recommended not to, its not strongly emphasized. As a result messed up trends that make fun of disabled people, for example, and therfore teach young impressionable kids as well as teens that joking or poking fun at topics like that is okay, so that as they grow up, they will continue the cycle, which is not at all helpful. Not only that but bully trends on social media can also be linked to f*t-shaming, sl*t-shaming, etc. on the internet. </h3>

<h3>In the above video, a trend spread where even parents were showing their child photos pf someone who looks different from them and tell them its someone they know in order to get a "funny reaction" out of them. As a result they are teaching their young impressionable kids that its okay to treat people who look differently than them, like they're hideous or weird.</h3>


  <h3>Bully culture is bad because its a form of online bullying taking the form of cool and fun trends. It is what schools call cyber bullying and its happening under the noses of big industries, who normally would care, but if its hidden as trend thats giving their app more engagment, will go along with it. </h3>
